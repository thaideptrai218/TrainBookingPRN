Report 3: Core Feature Development Report (Development Phase)

1.	Development Progress Overview
    -   As an AI, I do not have access to the project's development timeline, planned features, or actual completion status. This section requires human input regarding project management and progress tracking.

2.	Implemented Features
    Based on the codebase structure, the following core features appear to be implemented or are in an advanced stage of development:
    -   **User Authentication**: Functionality for user login and registration, managed by `LoginViewModel`, `RegisterViewModel`, and `AuthenticationService`.
    -   **Booking System**: Core features for searching, selecting seats, managing passenger details, and confirming bookings. This involves `BookingService`, `BookingConfirmationViewModel`, `BookingDetailsViewModel`, `SeatSelectionViewModel`, and `PassengerDetailsViewModel`.
    -   **Customer Interface**: A dedicated user interface for customers to interact with the booking system, primarily through `CustomerWindow` and `CustomerViewModel`.
    -   **Manager Interface**: A comprehensive administrative interface for managing various aspects of the train booking system, including:
        -   Coach Type Management (`CoachTypeManagementViewModel`, `CoachTypeManagementView`)
        -   Pricing Rule Management (`PricingRuleManagementViewModel`, `PricingRuleManagementView`)
        -   Route Management (`RouteManagementViewModel`, `RouteManagementView`)
        -   Seat Type Management (`SeatTypeManagementViewModel`, `SeatTypeManagementView`)
        -   Station Management (`StationManagementViewModel`, `StationManagementView`)
        -   Train Management (`TrainManagementViewModel`, `TrainManagementView`)
        -   Train Type Management (`TrainTypeManagementViewModel`, `TrainTypeManagementView`)
        -   Trip Management (`TripManagementViewModel`, `TripManagementView`)
        This is orchestrated by `ManagerWindow`, `ManagerViewModel`, and `MainManagerViewModel`.
    -   **Core Data Models**: A robust set of data models representing the entities within the system, such as `Booking`, `Coach`, `Passenger`, `Route`, `Seat`, `Station`, `Train`, `Trip`, and `User`, located in the `Models` directory.
    -   **Service Layer**: Dedicated service classes for various entities (e.g., `BookingService`, `RouteService`, `TrainService`) providing business logic and data access operations.

3.	Technical Implementation
    The application is implemented using the following technologies and architectural patterns:
    -   **UI Framework**: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is used for the graphical user interface, as evidenced by `.xaml` files (e.g., `App.xaml`, `MainWindow.xaml`) and the `Views` directory.
    -   **Programming Language**: C# is the primary programming language, indicated by `.cs` files throughout the project.
    -   **Data Access**: Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is utilized for object-relational mapping (ORM) and database interactions, suggested by the presence of `Context.cs` within the `Models` directory.
    -   **Architectural Pattern**: The project adheres to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, clearly separated into `Models`, `Views`, and `ViewModels` directories. This promotes separation of concerns and testability. `BaseViewModel` and `RelayCommand` further support this pattern.
    -   **Object-Oriented Principles**: The codebase demonstrates strong adherence to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance (e.g., `BaseViewModel`), and polymorphism, through its class structure, service interfaces (e.g., `IAuthenticationService`), and data models.
    -   **Multithreading Techniques**: While not explicitly detailed in the file structure, WPF applications often leverage asynchronous programming (e.g., `async/await`) for UI responsiveness during long-running operations. Specific implementation details would require deeper code analysis.

4.	Challenges and Solutions
    -   As an AI, I do not have information about the specific technical challenges encountered by the development team or the solutions they implemented. This section requires human insight into the development process.

5.	Git Commit History
    -   As an AI, I do not have access to the project's Git commit history or the ability to link to specific GitHub commits or branches. This section requires access to the version control system.

6.	Code Quality and Documentation
    -   The project structure suggests an organized approach to development, with clear separation of concerns (Models, Views, ViewModels, Services). The presence of interfaces for services (e.g., `IAuthenticationService`) indicates a focus on maintainability and testability.
    -   Internal documentation and code comments would need to be reviewed directly within the source files to provide a detailed summary.

7.	Testing Activities
    -   A dedicated test project, `TrainManagementWPF.Tests`, exists, containing unit tests for various services (e.g., `BookingServiceTests`, `CoachTypeServiceTests`, `PasswordServiceTests`). This indicates that automated testing is part of the development process.
    -   Details regarding manual testing activities, specific test coverage, known issues, or resolution plans are beyond the scope of what can be inferred from the file structure alone.

8.	Next Steps
    -   As an AI, I cannot outline planned activities for future phases. This section requires human input regarding project planning.
